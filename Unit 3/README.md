# Unit 3 Exercise and Discussion Questions
## In-Class Exercises

Please complete the following exercises. You do not need to submit anything, 
but it is recommended that you complete these.

1. Please complete [Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro Exercise 05](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d3618832b89844dda4c0b97c44ccf151). 
You can download the data from [here](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a944af0becbf47df98336a9e4881a6b8). Please submit the scripts that you 
create through the exercise. If you are doing the exercise in a Jupyter Notebook, 
feel free to submit the notebook instead of the script.
2. Please complete [Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro Exercise 06](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cef0aa5df9c54993a6c1cb1dfec5f553). 
You can download the data from [here](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3df07f29a0844d62af4338c52a40fda9). If you are doing the exercise 
in a Jupyter Notebook, feel free to submit the notebook instead of the script.

## Questions:

Please submit a text file or word document answering the following questions.

1. What are some typical environment variables that get set in a script?
2. What is the difference between required and optional parameters of 
geoprocessing tools and how can this impact writing a script?
3. In the [```numpy.zeros```](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html) function, 
what are the required parameters and what are the optional parameters?

# Unit 3 Assignment
## Homework Problems

1. Using the OSM.gdb as input, write a script that reads all the feature classes 
in a workspace and prints the name of each feature class and the geometry type of that feature class in the following format, for example: roads is a polyline feature class
2. Using the OSM.gdb as input, write a script that reads all the feature classes 
in a personal or file geodatabase and copies only the polygon feature classes to a new file geodatabase. You can assume there are no feature datasets in the exist-ing data, and the feature classes can keep the same name.
