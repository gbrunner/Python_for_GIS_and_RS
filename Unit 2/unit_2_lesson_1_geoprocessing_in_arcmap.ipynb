This will involve strginging together common geoprocessing tools from ArcGIS to perform larger tasks. You may have done this before in [Model Builder](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/what-is-modelbuilder-.htm). Through this class, I hope you find it beneficial to start creating these types of tools with Python rather than Model Builder.\n",
