## Homework Questions

1. What are the three types of cursors and what purpose does each serve?
2. What module do you import to access cursors?
3. Explain the difference between the [ArcGIS Field Calculator](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/calculate-field.htm) 
and Update Cursors? How are they similar?


# Unit 4 Assignment
Please complete both of these problems. These problems are relevant and helpful to understanding Project 1. The data to use is in the Exercise07.zip folder.

1. Write a script that creates a 15,000-meter buffer around features in the airports.shp feature class classified as an airport ( based on the FEATURE field ) and a 7,500-meter buffer around features classified as a seaplane base. The results should be two separate feature classes, one for each airport type.
2. Write a script that adds a text field to the roads.shp feature class called FERRY and populates this field with YES and NO values, depending on the value of the FEATURE field.
