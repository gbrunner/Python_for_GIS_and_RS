# Terminology
## [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)
Well-known text (WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector 
geometry objects on a map. A binary equivalent, known as well-known binary (WKB), 
is used to transfer and store the same information on databases. 
The formats were originally defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and 
described in their Simple Feature Access. The current standard definition is 
in the ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 standard.

## [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 
It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language 
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that 
is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar 
to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, 
Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal 
data-interchange language.

## [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising 
the standard library in the main Python distribution.

# Unit 5 In Class Assignment
## In-Class Exercises

Please complete [Exercise 9 from Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro.](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f8e466f8f2c2481f9a3c820ccfc1c35f) 
You can find the data [here.](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ce6ad466cd064a7099ee65de7bba3a49) I recommend trying this in an Jupyter notebook 
rather than IDLE. Please submit the notebook if you do this in Jupyter. 
Submit the Python scripts if you do it in IDLE or PyCharm.
