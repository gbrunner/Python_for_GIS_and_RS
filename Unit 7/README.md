# Unit 7 Exercise and Discussion Questions
This goes with Chapter 3 of Advanced Scripting for ArcGIS Pro. Please complete 
this tutorial on creating script tools: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cdb970479d5f4439ac5d2eb155bdd6f6

Here is the data: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fbb1335ef10944259899a3af6206e10e

Please complete the following question. Submit screen shots of the 
results for 1 and 2. Submit the Python script for 3:

1. Create a cloud storage connection to Landsat 8 in Amazon S3 if you 
havenâ€™t already. [Download the Landsat Descending Path Row shapefile.](https://prd-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/atoms/files/WRS2_descending_0.zip) 
Unzip it and view the shapefile in ArcGIS Pro. Identify a path row that 
covers Northern California. Use that path row to find the imagery over 
California in the Landsat 8 cloud storage connection. If you are interested 
in a challenge, find a path row over Northern California from the early 
September 2020 time frame and try to identify the locations of wildfires 
in the Landsat 8 imagery.
2. [SpaceNet](https://registry.opendata.aws/spacenet/) is an open geospatial dataset consisting of freely available imagery. 
That dataset is used as a test bed for computer vision, machine learning, 
deep learning, and GeoAI research. Create a new ArcGIS Pro project. 
In that project, create a cloud storage connection to the SpaceNet dataset. 
You do not need to specify the region when creating the cloud storage connection.
Search through the SpaceNet S3 bucket. Add a few images from the SpaceNet S3 
bucket to the map. What cities does SpaceNet have imagery for?
3. Make a copy of the random_sample.py script and call it random_percent.py. Modify 
the script so that the third parameter is a percentage of the number of input 
records as an integer between 1 and 100. Modify the script tool settings so 
that the input for this parameter is validated on the tool dialog box
