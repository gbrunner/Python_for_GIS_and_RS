 Hi Class, 

My name is Greg Brunner and I am the instructor for **GIS 4090\5090 – Programming for GIS 
and Remote Sensing**. I will be using Blackboard for course content management 
this semester. Please find the syllabus and relevant links here.

I currently plan to use the Des Peres 204 lab for each lecture. 
If you are not comfortable with attending class in-person, 
I intend to record every lecture and post them to Blackboard 
immediately following the lecture. If you plan on taking the course remotely, 
please let me know as I currently don’t have a record of that. 

This semester presents some logistical challenges 
that previous semesters have not. In order to get as much out of the 
course as possible this semester, I highly recommend the following: 

    1. Attend the lectures or watch the lecture recordings. 
    2. If you do not want to work in the Des Peres 204 lab, have a 
    good laptop that can support ArcGIS Pro. I will share the 
    software with you and get you licensed. 
    3. Order and read the textbook, [Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro by Paul A. Zandbergen.](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-ArcGIS-Paul-Zandbergen/dp/1589484991/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Nj5BRCZARIsABwxDKILofmhG-3-PbbnlMNQ5vUN_UOizfO_k7kX4_i4ky76Z1n8YHAjMjAaAnh9EALw_wcB&hvadid=414477414204&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1020519&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1731959480817667638&hvtargid=kwd-867877224600&hydadcr=24602_9648846&keywords=python+scripting+for+arcgis+pro&qid=1597413221&sr=8-2&tag=googhydr-20) 
    4. Do all the exercises, homework, and projects and complete them on time. 
    5. Communicate with me when you have a challenge or problem that you can not overcome. 

In preparation for class on Wednesday, please log into SLU’s 
[ArcGIS Online site](https://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html). 
Along the top of the landing page, you 
should see “Home”, “Gallery”, “Map”, “Scene”, “Notebook”, etc. 
Please make sure you see “Notebook” listed there. 
If you do not, please let me know before we meet on Wednesday. 

I’m looking forward to working with you this semester! 

Greg
