# Course Description
This course will introduce students to Python programming and its 
applications to remote sensing and GIS. Through completing this course, 
students will be able to use Python to perform common GIS and remote 
sensing analysis tasks, automate workflows, and develop custom Python 
tools. Topics will include describing data, manipulating data, 
automating spatial analysis tasks, creating Python scripts and tools, 
and using Python for imagery analysis. We will also introduce students to 
WebGIS and how Python can be used to interface with data that is shared online.

# Course Objectives
- Students will learn Python and understand how to use it to 
solve problems in GIS and Remote Sensing and will demonstrate 
their knowledge by completing multiple homework assignments and projects.
- Students will be encouraged to use Python through relevant 
examples and assignments.
- Students will begin implementing it in their own research 
projects such as theses and capstones.

# Materials
Course Materials will be shared using Blackboard. Slides, labs, 
and homework are in the folders that correspond to the specific units covered in class.

# Feedback and Assessment
In order to ensure that students are on track to achieve the course objectives, 
students will have weekly coding assignments. The coding 
assignments will be graded and returned before the next online 
lecture, where the solutions will be reviewed, and questions will 
be addressed. Feedback on respective assignments will also be given to 
each student through Blackboard. Weekly assignment will become the 
foundation for student projects which will serve as the benchmarks for 
whether students understand how to use programming to solve GIS and 
remote sensing problems. There will be 3 projects over the course of 
the semester. Two will be defined by the professor. The third and final 
project will be defined by the student in consultation with me. For the 
final project, the student will define the questions he or she wants to 
answer, find the data to answer it, code up a solution to the question(s), 
and put together a presentation on the project and solution that will be 
presented during our final class. For the final project, discussion with 
classmates and me is encouraged as each student will define his or her own 
project and goals. The instructor will make himself available for virtual 
office hours weekly on Mondays from 4 to 5 PM using Zoom. If you have 
questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to meet with me during office hours, 
send me an email, or schedule an ad-hoc meeting with me outside of our 
regular meetings or office hours. For week 1 of class, please post your 
name, discipline of study, and academic interests in the Introductions 
discussion channel in Blackboard. If you ever need to talk, do not 
hesitate to reach out to me.

# Homework
The purpose of the homework is twofold: to keep you thinking about 
Python outside of the lab and to prepare you for the next class. 
I do not want to overwhelm you with homework. I do want to ensure 
that you are learning how to use Python to solve GIS and remote 
sensing problems. Please do not hesitate to ask me or your classmates 
questions on homework if you are encountering difficulties. Furthermore, 
I would like your feedback as to whether assignments get too difficult or 
too easy so that I can adjust the assignments and in-class materials 
accordingly. Homework is to be submitted via blackboard before class on 
the day that it is due.

# In Class Exercises
The easiest way to learn to code is by writing code! Lectures are 
designed to be interactive. If I am typing code, you should be too! 
Lectures will be followed by in-class exercises that are designed to 
get you writing code on your own. The exercises that I have written 
as Python notebooks (.ipynb files) have questions throughout them. 
Please answer these questions and submit them via Blackboard before 
the beginning of the following week of class.

# Project 1
Project 1 will likely consist of working with 
tabular data (CSV or text file) or generating 
some report based on GIS data using Python. 
I will give the assignment by week 4. It is due 
before class on week 6.

# Project 2
Project 2 will likely consist of using Python to do some 
sort of spatial analysis or raster analysis. It will be 
assigned by week 9. It is due before class on week 11.

# Final Project
In my experience, all students and professionals need at 
least one demo or presentation that they can be prepared 
to give for a job interview, conference presentation, or 
other type of meeting. Through this class, I’d like each 
student to develop that demo or presentation, with the 
foundation of that presentation being some sort of spatial 
analysis, imagery analysis, or GIS analysis with Python. 
Each student will be responsible for a short 10 minute 
presentation to be given during either Week 14 or 15 of 
class on a project of their own choosing that will leverage 
Python. Before Spring Break (i.e. by Week 8), please submit 
to me a short write up (no more than 1 page) of what your 
project will be, what problem you will solve, how you will 
use Python to solve the problem. On week 14 or 15, please 
be prepared to give a 10 minute presentation explaining 
your problem, solution, how you got there, and hopefully 
some cool maps and results.
