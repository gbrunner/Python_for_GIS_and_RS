# Final Project Proposal
In my experience, all students and professionals need at least one demo or 
presentation that they can be prepared to give for a job interview, 
conference presentation, or other type of meeting. Through this class, 
Iâ€™d like each student to develop that demo or presentation, with the 
foundation of that presentation being some sort of spatial analysis, 
imagery analysis, or GIS analysis with Python. Each student will be 
responsible for a short 5-10 minute presentation to be given during 
the final week of class on a project of their own choosing that will 
leverage Python. In this discussion forum, please submit a short write 
up (no more than 5 bullet points) of what your project will be, 
what problem you will solve, how you will use Python to solve the 
problem. Also, please read and comment on at least 2 proposals 
from your classmates.

On December 2, please be prepared to give a 5-10 minute presentation 
to the class via Zoom explaining your problem, solution, how you got 
there, and hopefully some cool maps and results.

This is the first time I have used discussion forums in Blackboard, 
so please let me know if this isn't working as expected. **Start a 
"New Thread" and enter your proposal!**

For examples of what students have proposed in the past, see the 
Power Point slides in the **Final Project Proposal** folder.

**Due date for proposal submission is midnight, October 16.**
